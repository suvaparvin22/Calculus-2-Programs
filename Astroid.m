% Its general syntax --> linspace(start,stop,n(number of equally spaced
% points to generate between 'start' and 'stop'))
% In this program linspace generates a vector of evenly spaced values from 
% 0 to 2Ï€ (a full circle) with 1000 points.
% This parameter 't' will be used to calculate the x and y coordinates of
% points on the Astroid curve.

% Calculate the x and y coordinates of the Astroid curve
% These formulas represent the parametric equations of the Astroid curve.
% By raising cos(t) and sin(t) to the power of 3, the curve takes its 
% characteristic shape.
x = a * cos(t).^3;
y = a * sin(t).^3;
